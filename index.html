    <p>
        I'm a final year student at Trinity College Dublin, passionate about physics, mathematics, programming, problem-solving, and finance and banking.
        I am a currently working on my Capstone in Lie Algebras and Particle Physics, which involves me reviewing Howard Georgie's work, and several review papers. 
        I'm interested in getting involved with the financial world, and have been involved this year with the Trinity Student Managed Fund. I'm a naturally analytical and intuitive thinker, and I love puzzles, problems and technical projects.

    My repos are listed on Github, and you can find me @CharlieHF. I have worked mostly with C++, and Python, and have made great use of 
    these for modeling, and fitting and finding solutions to numerical problems. Some of my Projects include:


<ul>
<li>
    Using Machine Learning to play Rock/Paper/Scissors.
</li>
<li>
    Modelling the distribution of energies of molecules in a piston
</li>
<li>
    Finding Numerical Solutions to the Wave Function with Potential.
</li>
<li>Solving Higher Level ODEs using Runge-Kutta integration.</li>
</ul>

My extracurricular hobbies include Rock Climbing, Five a Side Football and Teaching.
I am passionate about making a difference and having a positive impact on the world around me. I have worked with non-profits and businesses I believe make a positive impact on the world, mostly involving teaching and inspiring youths to be interested in programming and engineering. 
I am eager to work on projects that give me the oppurtunity to benefit people's lives.
